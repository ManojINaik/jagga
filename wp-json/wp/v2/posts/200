Here\u2019s how our commitment to sustainability is making a difference, one wash at a time.<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Sustainability at the core<\/h5>\n<p>At AquaSonic, we believe that car care shouldn\u2019t come at the planet\u2019s expense. That\u2019s why sustainability is built into everything we do, from the chemistry in our washes to the technology in our tunnels.<\/p>\n<p>Many car washes waste hundreds of gallons of water per wash. We knew there had to be a better way. By implementing a state-of-the-art water reclamation system, AquaSonic recycles up to 90% of the water used in every wash. This isn\u2019t just good for the environment\u2014it also ensures our washes are efficient and effective.<\/p>\n<h5>Smarter chemistry, safer choices<\/h5>\n<p>Traditional cleaning agents can harm the environment, but AquaSonic takes a different approach.
