Absolutely. Here&#8217;s Why."},"content":{"rendered":"<p>At AquaSonic, we get this question all the time: \u201cIs it safe to take my [insert prized vehicle here] through your car wash?\u201d Whether you&#8217;re rolling in a dually truck, a lifted pickup, a Jeep Wrangler, or a soft top Bronco, the short answer is: yes, it\u2019s safe\u2014because we designed it that way.<\/p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>Bigger Trucks, Duallies, and Lifted Rigs Welcome<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our tunnel was engineered with oversized vehicles in mind. We can accommodate trucks up to<strong> 90 inches wide and 84 inches tall<\/strong>, making us one of the few washes built to handle some duallies, lifted pickups, wide work trucks, and SUVs with racks.<\/p>\n<p>And because we use a<strong> &#8220;magic carpet&#8221; belt system<\/strong> instead of a traditional track, there\u2019s no need to carefully align your wheels or worry about scuffing those rims. Just roll on in\u2014we\u2019ve eliminated the stress and minimized the risk.<\/p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>Soft Tops? We\u2019ve Got You Covered (Literally)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We know how protective soft top owners can be\u2014and we respect it. Whether you\u2019re driving a soft top Jeep, Bronco, convertible Mustang, or Miata, AquaSonic is a safe choice.<\/p>\n<p>Our tunnel uses soft-touch technology and chemistry that\u2019s gentle on fabrics and vinyl. In fact, we\u2019ve found our wash formulas actually help reduce fading and UV damage\u2014like a sunscreen for your soft top.<\/p>\n<p>That said, it\u2019s always best to check your vehicle owner\u2019s manual\u2014some manufacturers are extra cautious in their recommendations (and that\u2019s okay). If you ever want to do a visual check with one of our team members before your first wash, we\u2019re more than happy to help.<\/p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>Our Promise: Safety First, Always<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Safety is our priority. Our tunnel is built for maximum protection, and most damages result from pre-existing conditions, modifications, or failure to follow safe wash practices\u2014but if we\u2019re at fault, we\u2019ll make it right. That\u2019s the AquaSonic way.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what we\u2019re not responsible for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-existing vehicle damage, like loose or damaged trim<\/li>\n<li>Non-factory or aftermarket parts<\/li>\n<li>Spare tire covers or roof rack systems<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles 20+ years old<\/li>\n<li>Power antennas, running boards, mirrors, or wipers left on<\/li>\n<li>Not following your vehicle&#8217;s washing guidelines<\/li>\n<li>Not following team member directions in the tunnel<\/li>\n<li>Steering or shifting out of neutral during the wash<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If damage results from any of these factors, we ask that you take responsibility\u2014just like we will if it\u2019s something we did wrong. Any concerns? Just talk to a manager the same day, and we\u2019ll sort it out\u2014no drama.<\/p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>No Contracts. No Quibble.
