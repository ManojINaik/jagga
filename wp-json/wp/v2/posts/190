Located at 6818 US Hwy 19, this location is strategically positioned to serve the New Port Richey and Port Richey residents with state-of-the-art car wash services.<\/h3>\n<p>This momentous occasion represents a much larger entrance into the car wash industry, as AquaSonic currently has an additional 17 locations in the pipeline across cities in Florida, including Tampa, Orlando, Palm Beach, and Jacksonville.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are thrilled to break ground on our first car wash location, marking a significant milestone for AquaSonic Car Wash and our investors,.Today\u2019s event represents not just the expansion of our brand in Florida and beyond, but also our commitment to building America\u2019s Smartest Car Wash. We look forward to serving our customers with the same innovation and excellence that have defined our company since its inception.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>shared AquaSonic CEO, Garrett Solomon.<\/p>\n<p>The AquaSonic team has spent the last several years developing a knockout brand concept that is positioned to take the car wash industry by storm.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We had previous experience investing in car wash that excited us about the possibilities in the marketplace, but also equally frustrated us. The limited availability of high-quality car wash services for car owners was astounding to us. Before we made any key strategic decisions, we first completed extensive consumer research to understand consumer desires for car wash services. That data was used as the starting point to craft AquaSonic, an intelligent brand that delivers excellence in each area consumers asked us for more in.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>shared Ian Rickwood, Chairman of AquaSonic\u2019s Board of Directors.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the technology and innovation that AquaSonic will be bringing into the business is still highly confidential. \u201cOur team has been hard at work to create something customers have never seen before,\u201d shared Shannon Kessell, Head of Marketing for AquaSonic Car Wash. \u201cWe are looking forward to unveiling a best-in-class experience both online and in-store leading up to this first location opening in Q1 2025.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For accredited investors looking to diversify their portfolio, AquaSonic might be the passive opportunity they\u2019ve been waiting for.
