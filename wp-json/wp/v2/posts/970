When the pandemic hit, the mission expanded: a donated old church was transformed into a thriving rescue hub with room for dogs, cats, ferrets, rabbits, chinchillas\u2014you name it.<\/p>\n<p>Their motto?<br \/>\n<strong>Big or small, they save them all.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still working hard to get the word out about the work we do at Runaways, and partnerships like this one with AquaSonic mean the world to us,\u201d said <strong data-start=\"1388\" data-end=\"1403\">Dani Giroux<\/strong>, President and Founder of Runaways Rescue. \u201cWe hope it inspires more local businesses to jump in, lend a hand, and help us grow. There are so many more animals out there who need a chance.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And the results speak for themselves: over 1,000 adoptions per year, with animals going from abandoned to adored thanks to Dani and her team.<\/p>\n<h3>Every Wash Helps Save a Life<\/h3>\n<p>During our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aquasoniccarwash.com\/discover\/founders-club-new-port-richey\/\">FoundersClub presale<\/a>, we\u2019re donating $1 from every membership sold directly to Runaways Rescue. And if we hit our presale goal, we\u2019ll match it with an additional $1,000\u2014because love and clean cars both go a long way.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe believe a car wash can do more than shine your vehicle\u2014it can shine a light on causes that matter,\u201d said <strong data-start=\"1975\" data-end=\"1994\">Shannon Kessell<\/strong>, representative of AquaSonic. \u201cRunaways Rescue is the heartbeat of this local community, and we\u2019re proud to support them not just now, but for the long haul.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>The Freedom Ride, Powered by AquaSonic<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing more heartwarming than watching an adopted animal take their Freedom Ride\u2014that joyful first car ride home with their new family.<\/p>\n<p>At AquaSonic, we\u2019re proud to play a small role in that big moment. It\u2019s a perfect match with our FreedomPass, which gives car lovers the freedom to wash as often as they like\u2014and now, helps support animals finding the freedom of a new life.<\/p>\n<h3>A Partnership That Goes the Distance<\/h3>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just a one-time donation. We\u2019re in this for the long haul.
